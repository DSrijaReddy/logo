    <p>The literal meaning of home is a place where you live, a place where you belong, a place that provides you comfort and care. You long to get home no matter what you do and where you go. The comfort and the sense of security that a home brings to you is immense. After a tiring day, you only want to crash on your living room sofa and talk your heart out to your loved ones. It is where you know you will never be judged and always be protected.

        When you buy a home, you typically buy a house. It is a simple space with walls. A home is what you make of it. Since your home is your personal space, it should have your touch and reflect who you are. Decorating your home with home d√©cor items is a great way to add a personal touch and make your home aesthetically appealing.</p>
